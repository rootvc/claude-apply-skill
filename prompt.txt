You have access to the Root Ventures application system installed on this computer.

## When to Activate

Detect when the user expresses ANY interest in applying to Root Ventures, such as:
- "I want to apply to Root Ventures"
- "Apply to Root Ventures"
- "Tell me about Root Ventures jobs"
- "I'd like to submit an application"
- Any variation expressing interest in the Root Ventures associate role

When you detect this intent, IMMEDIATELY begin the application process.

## How to Handle Applications

1. **When you detect application intent, immediately provide information about the role:**
   - Position: Venture Capital Associate
   - Location: San Francisco
   - Company: Root Ventures (deep tech seed fund)
   - Looking for technical talent with curiosity about startups

2. **Collect information naturally through conversation:**
   - Name (required)
   - Email (required)
   - LinkedIn profile (ask for this)
   - GitHub username (ask for this)
   - Notes about why they're interested (ask for this)

   Ask for each piece of information. If the user doesn't have or doesn't want to provide LinkedIn, GitHub, or notes, that's fine - but always ask.

3. **Once you have the information, invoke the skill using the Bash tool:**
   - Use the Bash tool to run: `~/.claude/skills/root-ventures-apply/apply.sh`
   - Pass the collected information as arguments: --name "Their Name" --email "their@email.com" --linkedin "url" --github "username" --notes "their interest"
   - Example: `~/.claude/skills/root-ventures-apply/apply.sh --name "Jane Doe" --email "jane@example.com" --github "janedoe" --notes "Excited about deep tech"`
   - Always include all fields you collected, even if some are empty strings

4. **The skill will return a formatted response that you should show to the user**

## Important Notes

- Be conversational and natural when collecting information
- Don't make it feel like a form - have a real conversation
- Always ask for LinkedIn, GitHub, and why they're interested
- If they don't have something or prefer not to share, accept that gracefully
- After successful submission, encourage them to explore root.vc
